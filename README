Audio::Sndio
============

Audio::Sndio is a Perl interface to OpenBSD's libsndio. Currently, only
the low-level bindings (under ext/) are in working order, and they lack
tests. You probably don't want to use that code in production just yet.
Eventually, there will be some high-level modules that wrap those
bindings in a more Perlish way.

The reason there are no tests is that I haven't yet figured out the
best way to stub libsndio calls in XS, and I don't want to rely on
audio being usable on the system running tests.
